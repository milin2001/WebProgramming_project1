Hangman Game Project

Summary Report

Introduction
In this project, we worked to build a hangman game with four levels of difficulties, and for 
every word to be guessed, a clue pops up on the screen so that it is easier for the user to guess 
the correct words. This game also has user login and signup requirements.
Aditya Rajani and Milin Gujrati did this project.

Overview
This game was built using mainly three languages of web development, HTML, CSS, and PHP. 
We used HTML, CSS, and PHP for the front end; we used PHP and MySQL for the back end. The 
goal of this project was to make a web-based game, and we chose Hangman as the ideal game
because it is something we played a lot in high school as a kid. 

Risk and challenges
The first and foremost challenge we, as team members, had had standard free time together to 
sit and discuss the overall structure of the project.
While writing the code for the actual game and game functions, we had several bugs to solve, 
like the clue not popping, Hangman not building, and the restart button not working.
The login and registration page issues related to the MySQL database were not responding 
several times and showed an incorrect password, though the password was correct. 

Project Timeline
This project was built in four weeks

Week 1
As a team, we first brainstormed through different ideas of what game we could build, and
once we were affirmed that the hangman game was the right option for us, we both divided 
our work equally. We planned a roadmap of how we will tackle each task and how much work 
we would accomplish each week for the game to be ready before the due date. 

Week 2
Created login and signup page using PHP and MySQL, ensuring that the user's database created 
using MySQL was validated and connected smoothly with PHP on localhost. 
Styling the front end of the game, creating the homepage, game levels page, creating CSS 
styling page for the entire game. 
Created text file for the word and clue. Collecting images for our Hangman.

Week 3
In the third week, we coded in PHP for the actual game in the backend that the user is going to 
play,
That included coding for the game function, designing the layout for the letter keyboard, 
building the code for the game that calls various game functions to see if the user is winning the 
game or Hangman is building, created a standard navigation bar.

Week 4 
This week was dedicated to testing our game and fixing the minor bugs we were getting while 
playing the game, also prepared a demo video for the project presentation.
